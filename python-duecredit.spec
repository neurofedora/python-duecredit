%description
duecredit is being conceived to address the problem of inadequate citation of
scientific software and methods, and limited visibility of donation requests
for open-source software.

It provides a simple framework (at the moment for Python only) to embed
publication or other references in the original code so they are automatically
collected and reported to the user at the necessary level of reference detail,
i.e. only references for actually used functionality will be presented back if
software provides multiple citeable implementations.
